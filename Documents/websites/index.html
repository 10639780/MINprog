		<p> There are many ways to overcome a crisis. One of which will be explored in this page. As a kind of anti-travelogue, it will be about staying at home, doing as little as humanly possible.  I hope to excite you while surely, very little is going to happen. A great task. Incidentally this will precisely be the point: enlarging the small things that happen in such a way that they might surprise us. To do this I have the luxury of calling in the help of Roxanne, a cat. Much in the way Roxanne doesn't cease to be amazed by my bicycle. I brought it in because it needs small repairs. In conclusion a word about boredom. It feels eerie when pointlessness creeps up on me. To a point that I have to find a way to calm it down. Roxanne seems like the perfect teacher, I might actually get rid of this bug called boredom. </p>
